  summary: A simple framework for building complex web applications.
  description: |
    Flask is a lightweight [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/) web application framework. It is designed
    to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
    complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/)
    and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) and has become one of the most popular Python web
    application frameworks.
    Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
    project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
    libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
    community that make adding new functionality easy.
